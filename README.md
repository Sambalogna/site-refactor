# Site-refactor

## Description 

Horiseon's website needed refactoring here are all of the changes to the original index.html 

## Table of Contents

* [SEO](#seo)
* [header](#header)
* [title](#title)
* [Alt](#alt)
* [H_tags](#h)


## seo
The div for search-engine-optimization needed an id for the menu link to utilize href="#search-engine-optimization"

## header 

The header was contained within a div tag with the id = "header". This was changed to header to make the html elements semantically clear.

## title

Changed title from webpage to Horiseon

## alt

added alt attributes to all images on the webpage.

## h 

made the h tags senquential. This caused Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management to increase to the size of h2. The footer had an h2 tag which is now h3 to follow sequence causing Made with <3 by Horiseon to shrink to the size of an h3 tag

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```






The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

🏆 The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
