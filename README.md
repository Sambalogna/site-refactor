## seo
The div for search-engine-optimization needed an id for the menu link to utilize href="#search-engine-optimization"

## header 

The header was contained within a div tag with the id = "header". This was changed to header to make the html elements semantically clear.

## title

Changed title from webpage to Horiseon

## alt

added alt attributes to all images on the webpage.

## h 

made the h tags sequential. This caused Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management to increase to the size of h2. The footer had an h2 tag which is now h3 to follow sequence causing Made with <3 by Horiseon to shrink to the size of an h3 tag

## sections

made the divs that held classes: benefits and content into section tags for semantic purposes.

## footer

changed the div class ="footer" to just footer for semantic html purposes

## nav 

changed div around the navigation elements in the header for semantic html purposes
